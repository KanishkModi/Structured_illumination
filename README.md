# Simulation of Structured Illumination Microscopy
### Supervisor: Prof. Stefanie Kroker <br> Guides: Dr. Tim Kaeseberg and Mohammad Nouri

*All codes are supposed to run on JCM Control App with an official JCM Wave license."

The final codes for the TU Braunschweig summer internship in 2024 are uploaded here:
- "Optical_imaging_v4" has structured illumination integrated with far-field imaging for a single phase. Using this multiple times (typically 9) should theoretically result in a higher resolution image than standard optical microscopy.
- "Optical_imaging_v3" has standard plane wave illumination and the code for far-field imaging of the same. The image here can be compared with the one from version 4 to see that using structured illumination just once doesn't result in a better image directly.
- "diffraction_test" was used for testing basic diffraction simulations.
- "test" might have various commented codes which were used to get a hang of JCM Wave software.
